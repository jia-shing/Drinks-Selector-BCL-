# üçæ Drinks-Selector-BCL-
A web application bootstrapped on R using the Shiny package. 
Based on user input, the app will reactively recommend available drinks in the price range and geographical region.

Available for access on my personal [R Shiny Server](https://jia-shing.shinyapps.io/JS_Alcohol_Selector/)
